#  Description

Here i posted my homeworks for the computational physics course. 

##  Homework 1

In the first homework, i needed to find the best angle for a artillery piece in order to have the maximum artillery fire.

##  Homework 2

In the second homework, i had to simulate an anarmonic oscilator, while also implementing friction.

##  Homework 3

Here, i had to simulate some elastic resorts and a couple of bodies with different mass.

##  Homework 4

In the last homework, i made a couple double-oscilators with different masses and the same starting position, in order to observe how quicly they get different trajectories.
